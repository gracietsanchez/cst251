    <h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
    <p> The goal of this lab was to learn how to create a local html file on my computer and upload it via Github. <p/>
    <h2> Challenges</h2>
    <p> I now understand how to start and edit a file using Atom. However, I am still struggling with learning how to formet everything in Atom. I have been utilizing the reverse inspect technique Wes introduced to us. I am using this to roughly base my code and then redoing it for myself. </p>
    <h2> Results</h2>
    <p> I am really crossing my fingures that you are able to read everything I have been coding so far! </p>
